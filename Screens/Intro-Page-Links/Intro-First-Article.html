            Students in the JCPS Justice Now program are trying to fix the many challenges facing the community. On Saturday, they were given a platform to share their solutions, at a soon-to-be annual event, called Justice Fest.

The event is the result of a partnership by the Derby Festival, Churchill Downs and Humana. The organizations launched the Derby Equity and Community Initiative earlier this year, and Justice Fest was what leaders call the first phase.

"One of the best places to start is with youth," said Kentucky Derby Festival CEO, Matt Gibson. "To start to give them the understanding that they do have a voice, and they do have a say in what happens in their society."

After the initiative was created, third through 12th-grade students in the Justice Now program began identifying and researching community-wide issues. Those include but are not limited to homelessness, trash disposal concerns, inclusiveness, and historical content from diverse communities. The students then created a plan to address these issues.

"They talked about what they wanted to do to change the community," said Justice Now co-founder, NyRee Clayton-Taylor. "They researched, they presented, and now what you're seeing is them doing their pitches to get funding."

The students were split into 18 different groups and presented their ideas to business leaders, mentors and advisors at the event in the Kentucky International Convention Center.

"I know we can't help a lot of people, but at least we can help some people," said fifth-grade student, Mia Staples. "I have a lot of plans, I'm not sure if they're all going to fulfill, but if I try hard enough they might."

Gibson noted, the event was better than they had hoped, and with a new-normal approaching, he said this could be the start of a better Jefferson County.

"There is going to be things that we uncover for our society, and this community to make it better," said Gibson. "It will be amazing if a lot of those discussions started here."
