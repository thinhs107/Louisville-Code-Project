Application is used to demostrate the understanding of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Index pages is calling two JSON files, which include the following:
    1) Stats.json
    2) https://www.balldontlie.io/api/v1/games

Stats.json is used to display the top players in NBA leagues
since the json is unnormalized I wrote a sort function to get the top five players, based on the user selection
off points, assits and rebound

The second JavaScript was used to fetch API from a website and display the "current" that is being played. (Note: this is a
test API for NBA and do not reflect on the current NBA scores)

I also used CSS to customize the layout of the pages.
